# CIS267_HW02_MasonMcLaughlin

 CIS267 is a brick breaker clone. The player moves with either the arrow keys or a and d. They can press escape to pause. They are given three lives to destroy the bricks with some of the bricks dropping power ups. This includes an extra life, increase in paddle size, and decrease in paddle size

 I had many issues with this project the lives and score text did not want to appear in my game. The biggest was sending data to a new scene I was unable to do that the both levels are in the same scene. I also had in issue when building it, but that problem seems to be fixed.
